# Arabic Question Answering System using AraBART

## Overview
This project implements an Arabic Question Answering (QA) system using the AraBART model fine-tuned on the ARCD (Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset). The system can extract answers from given Arabic text contexts based on questions posed in Arabic.

## Features
- Fine-tuned AraBART model for Arabic question answering
- Support for context-based question answering
- Easy-to-use pipeline interface
- Jupyter notebook for model training
- Modular code structure

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Datasets
- NumPy
- Pandas

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd Omar-YYoussef-QA_arabert_finetune
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets numpy pandas
```

## Usage

### Using the Pre-trained Model
```python
from model import answer_question, qa_pipeline

# Define your context and question in Arabic
context = "Your Arabic context here"
question = "Your Arabic question here"

# Get the answer
answer = answer_question(qa_pipeline, context, question)
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

### Training the Model
The training process is documented in `QA_arabert_finetune_code.ipynb`. The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model configuration
- Training pipeline setup
- Training execution
- Model evaluation

## Model Details

### Architecture
- Base Model: BERT-base-arabert
- Fine-tuned on: ARCD dataset
- Task: Extractive Question Answering

### Training Parameters
- Learning Rate: 2e-4
- Batch Size: 8
- Epochs: 3
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Weight Decay: 0.02
- Warmup Ratio: 0.1

### Evaluation Metrics
Below are the comparative performance metrics for different Arabic language models:

| Model        | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | WER    | BLEU   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ArabianGpt01| 0.8464  | 0.7562  | 0.8443  | 0.3190  | 0.6353  |
| AraBert     | 0.8415  | 0.7537  | 0.8391  | 0.2765  | 0.6101  |
| DistilBert  | 0.2625  | 0.1117  | 0.2492  | 1.0226  | 0.0240  |

Key observations:
- ArabianGpt01 shows the best overall performance across ROUGE metrics
- AraBert performs very similarly to ArabianGpt01
- DistilBert shows significantly lower performance across all metrics except WER
- Both ArabianGpt01 and AraBert achieve strong ROUGE-1 scores around 0.84
